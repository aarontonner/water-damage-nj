## 1. Coastal Flooding

With its location near the ocean, Brick is vulnerable to coastal flooding during storms and hurricanes. Rising tides and storm surges can lead to widespread water intrusion, especially in low-lying areas.

Solution: Install flood barriers or levees around your property. Invest in flood insurance to cover potential damages, and regularly inspect your home's foundation for weak spots that could allow water ingress.

## 2. Heavy Rainfall

Brick experiences frequent rain, especially during the storm season. Heavy downpours can overwhelm drainage systems, causing water to seep into basements and crawl spaces.

Solution: Maintain and clear gutters regularly to ensure efficient water flow. Consider installing a French drain system to channel water away from your homeâ€™s foundation.

## 3. High Water Table

The naturally high water table in Brick increases the risk of groundwater seeping into basements during prolonged rain or wet seasons.

Solution: Waterproof your basement by sealing floors and walls with epoxy. Installing a sump pump with a backup battery can also mitigate the risk of groundwater flooding.

## 4. Aging Plumbing Systems

Many homes in Brick were built decades ago, and aging plumbing systems are prone to leaks, corrosion, or pipe bursts.

Solution: Schedule routine inspections with a licensed plumber to detect early signs of wear and tear. Replace old or corroded pipes with modern materials such as PEX or copper.

## 5. Clogged Gutters and Downspouts

Leaves, debris, and dirt can clog gutters, causing water to overflow and damage your home's siding, roof, or foundation.

Solution: Clean your gutters seasonally and install gutter guards to prevent blockages. Downspouts should extend at least 10 feet from your foundation to redirect water safely.

## 6. Faulty Appliances

Appliances like washing machines, dishwashers, and water heaters can develop leaks due to worn-out hoses or mechanical failures.

Solution: Replace appliance hoses every 5 years and inspect seals and connections regularly. Use a water leak detector for early alerts of potential issues.

## 7. Roof Leaks

Missing or damaged shingles, especially after storms, allow water to infiltrate your roof and attic.

Solution: Conduct semi-annual roof inspections or after severe storms. Replace damaged shingles and clear debris to maintain roof integrity.

## 8. Poor Grading

Improper grading can direct rainwater toward your foundation, increasing the risk of structural damage.

Solution: Consult a landscaping professional to regrade your property, ensuring water flows away from your home.

## 9. Sump Pump Failures

When sump pumps fail due to mechanical issues or power outages, basements become vulnerable to flooding.

Solution: Test your sump pump monthly and install a backup system powered by batteries or a generator for emergencies.

## 10. Sewer Backups

During heavy rains, municipal sewer systems may become overwhelmed, leading to wastewater backups into homes.

Solution: Install a backwater valve to prevent sewage from entering your property. Avoid pouring grease or large objects down your drains to reduce sewer clogs.
